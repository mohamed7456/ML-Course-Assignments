# ML-Course-Assignments

This repository contains a collection of machine learning assignments completed as part of my _"Machine Learning - CSAI 253 - Spring 2024"_ course at _University of Science and Technology at Zewail City_. The assignments focus on implementing and applying several core ML algorithms, with an emphasis on building some from scratch to demonstrate a deep understanding of their inner workings.
